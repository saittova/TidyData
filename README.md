TidyData
========

This repo is for creating a tidy data set.

The data used here is aquired from address: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This repo includes run_analysis.R which holds the code for gathering, joining and extrating the data and calculating wanted results.

When you run the run_analysis.R make sure that there is a Data -folder in your working directory where the data is, e.g. "Data/features.txt"

To understand the code in more detail read CodeBook.md.
